As the AI is trained on more and more examples created by AI the quality will mediocritize a lot. Specific complex problems can have complex solutions but that is at best suboptimal. The best quality for a developer when that happens will be still architecturing with good practices, thinking of the simplest solution that solves the problem at hand for future scalability, readability and extensibility.

I believe AI tools are parasites feeding off hosts like Stack Overflow for short-term gains. As hosts like SO die, so too will the parasites. The most valuable skills that will become rare will be 1) critical thinking, 2) the ability to read and understand documentation for one’s self, 3) the ability to read source code (especially of one’s tools) and distinguish between the author’s intent and its actual behavior, 4) the ability to adapt to new language paradigms as people discover that the key to improved software development productivity is not AI-generated content but better language design. AI tools will be good for quickly summarizing widely understood concepts and reinventing wheels, but as a tool for writing code, I see that it is mostly creating suffering.	63808.0	8.0

Being 1H watching computer working while having to accept shit interactively is not truly great. 

I am aware that there are lot of non great coders selling IA ""work"" on the freelancer , i am not one of those, yet. 

Seems that in the future, most of good coders will use IA to save time and effort. 
I cant say anything else about future, but is not probable that non-ia coders can defeat IA ones in the very short term.

If you can use a chat is great, but not enough. If you don't know how to create things you cannot check for IA return. So, bussiness really interested into ""trust his code"" should have either real persons, or real ia-coders that know to manage.

Non coders coding will just cost you more in long term.

So, those that where ""great coders"" in the past, will remain as ""best coders"" in the future.

Great coders are not menaced, but they must adapt to new era to keep themselves ""in the hill"".
